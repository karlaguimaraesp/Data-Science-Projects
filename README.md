# Projetos-Guiados - COURSERA


**NLP: Twitter Sentiment Analysis**

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Project Overview: This introductory reading material will walk you through the project.
NLP: Twitter Sentiment Analysis: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
Project Structure
The hands on project on Twitter Sentiment Analysis is divided into following tasks:

Task #1: Understand the Problem Statement and business case 
Task #2: Import libraries and datasets
Task #3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
Task #4: Plot the word cloud
Task #5: Perform data cleaning - removing punctuation
Task #6: Perform data cleaning - remove stop words
Task #7: Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)
Task #8: Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization
Task #9: Understand the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers
Task #10: Train a Naive Bayes Classifier
Task #11: Assess trained model performance



**Deep Learning with PyTorch: Neural Style Transfer**
Now we will build Neural Style Transfer. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

Task 1 : Set google colab runtime
Task 2 : Loading VGG-19 pretrained model
Task 3 : Preprocess Image
Task 4 : Deprocess Image
Task 5 : Create content and style loss 
Task 6 : Get content,style features and create gram matrix
Task 7 : Training loop
